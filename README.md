# Minecraft Content Installer - Easily install Minecraft Custom Content #

The current ways to install Minecraft custom content isn't actually that
 intuitive for non-technical people. Here's a small application designed to
 make installing content a bit easier.

Started with [MCCI.py], a Python script that implements the basic behaviour.
 I'm rewriting it in Java, because asking people to install the correct version
 of Python doesn't really solve our problem.

I'm real sorry that the documentation/commenting is crap, but I just wanted to
 boot this one out the door finally. I'll look back into it at some point, I
 promise.
